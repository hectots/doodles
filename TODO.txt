# TODO

- Implement the genetic algorithm.
- DNA could contain the following:
	- 8 slots for the rules.
	- slots for the renderer parameters.
	- slot for generations to grow.
- Fitness function could check for:
	- collisions
	- distribution
	- symmetry
- Renderer does not have to draw anything, only store positions and size to use in the fitness calculations.
